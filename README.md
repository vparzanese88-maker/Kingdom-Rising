# Kingdom Rising

An EverQuest-style browser MMORPG. Two brothers split their poisoned father's kingdom. Pick a side, level up a hero, gather timber and stone, raise your kingdom, and send war parties to kill the other king.

## Play it
It's plain HTML and JavaScript. There's no build step and nothing to install.

- **Online:** turn on GitHub Pages for this repo (Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / root). The game will be at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.
- **On your own computer:** browsers block some features when you double-click the file, so serve the folder instead:
  - `python3 -m http.server 8000`, then open http://localhost:8000
  - or `npx serve .`

## More games in this repo
Each one is a single self-contained HTML page:
- `arcade.html`: a menu page linking to every game.
- `line-of-battle/`: Line of Battle, a 3D Civil War infantry shooter.
- `hold-aim-fire/`: Hold, Aim, Fire, a Civil War volley-timing game.
- `dead-end-boulevard/`: Dead End Boulevard, a zombie street survival game.

With GitHub Pages on, they live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/line-of-battle/` and so on.

## Project layout
- `index.html`: the page, all the CSS, and the script tags. The load order of the scripts matters.
- `js/` (in load order):
  - `data.js`: classes, races, items, monsters, regions and quests data.
  - `audio.js`: procedural music and sound effects (Web Audio).
  - `world.js`: world, city, dungeon and sewer generation.
  - `sprites.js`: all character and scenery drawing.
  - `game.js`: combat, movement, abilities and monster AI.
  - `systems.js`: cities, NPCs, quests, saving and multiplayer.
  - `mercs.js` and `mercui.js`: mercenaries and their windows.
  - `render.js`: the renderer.
  - `ui.js`: the HUD and windows.
  - `travel.js`: realms, ferries and zones.
  - `war.js`: siege engines, barracks, raids, the CPU rival, victory and Vinny.
  - `kingdom.js`: lore, gathering, the king's building works, town games and the cover page.
  - `tips.js`: tips for new players, the healer respawn, and the hotbar blink.
  - `story.js`: the cinematic story for a new hero.
  - `affinity.js`: monster weaknesses and resistances.
  - `group.js`: grouping.
  - `menus.js`: the main menu and hero creation.
  - `main.js`: boot and input.
- When you change a file, bump `?v=` on every script tag and `window.KR_VERSION` in `index.html` so browsers fetch the new copy.

## Saving and multiplayer
- Outside claude.ai, heroes and kingdoms are saved in each player's own browser (localStorage).
- The live multiplayer (seeing other players and grouping) and the cloud saves use claude.ai's artifact services, so they only work in the claude.ai version. Everything else plays the same on GitHub Pages.
